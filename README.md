# Medullo
Medullo is a web application that provides a platform for users to share and search for resources. The core idea of this application is to provide users with a medium to share their resources thereby enabling them access to resources, instead of having to buy or download multiple copies of the same resource. This application could well be used among students to share resources like class lecture notes or lecture videos or solution to problems.This can also help students connect with other students who are pursuing similar courses of interest and engage in a communal process of passing down study materials. It can also help users in general, to find people with similar interests and share the things they love. This encourages the habit of reducing and reusing which could in turn contribute to the global process of waste reduction in the long term. Once a user wants a specific resource, a resource for that request is raised. Once the request is approved by the resource owner, contact of the resource owner is shown. This feature provides for the privacy of resource owner and eliminates spamming. The upload feature enables for sharing of resources with the global community.
